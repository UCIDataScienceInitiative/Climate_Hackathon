Welcome to the UCI Data Science Initiative Climate Science Hackathon! The following contains the rules and schedule for the weekend along with descriptions of the data sets available for you to analyze. 


# Rules
1. *No contact with people outside your team* (except for the helpers, of course!)
2. You are free to use any software for the analysis and visualizations, including open source packages (e.g. scikit-learn, etc)
3. *All plots and graphs of the data must be your own*, but can be produced using aforementioned packages/software (you cannot simply take a plot from a paper or online)
4. You have from 10 am Saturday morning until the presentations at 1 pm Sunday to perform your analysis. We must leave the building at midnight Saturday, but feel free to continue working elsewhere.
5. **You only have 5 minutes to present your project to the judges (plus 1 minute to answer questions)!** You will be cut off once the time limit is reached in order to get through the presentations in a timely manner. Use this time wisely to convey the main results and graphics from your project. Think of the presentation as a elevator speech or sales pitch. You will be judged on *creativity, originality, and potential impact*.
