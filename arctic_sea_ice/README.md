## Description
Reconstruction of Arctic sea ice from 1850 to 2013 from the [NSIDC](http://nsidc.org/about/overview). The data was reformatted into csv files for your convenience with each file containing the sea ice concentration and source of the measurement for a span of 10 years, measured monthly, at 1/4 degree latitude and longitude increments. Dates are formatted as character strings of YYYY-MM-DD.

The original data in netCDF4 format is available [here](https://nsidc.org/data/g10010). Please see [description.pdf](https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/Climate_Hackathon/blob/master/arctic_sea_ice/description.pdf) for a detailed description of the data.
